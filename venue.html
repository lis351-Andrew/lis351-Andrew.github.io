		<h1>Venue</h1>
		
		When looking at the venue, the main thing to understand is that there are multiple places that you can look at to stand in.
		
		Pit
		You can be in the moshpit, which is where people will likely be jumping and bumping into each other. This area is right in front of the stage.
		
		Balcony
		You can be in the balcony, which is an area that is above the stage and looks down on it. This area is usually farther from the stage, but you will almost certainly be able to see well
